// 1. Setting types *******************************************************************************
let myString: any;
// I can assign myString like this:
myString = 'Bee stinger';
// Why is there a problem with this? What can I do to fix this?
// because type of myString is "string". By changing it to any it can now accept type
// also replaced "var" with "let", to use newer feature of JAVA
myString = 9;

// 2. Setting the types for function parameters ***************************************************
function sayHello(name: any) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
// This is working great:
console.log(sayHello('Kermit'));
// Why isn't this working? I want it to return "Hello, 9!"
// similar problem and solution as above.
console.log(sayHello(9));

//3 Optional parameters ***************************************************************************

function fullName(firstName: string, lastName: string, middleName?: string) {
  let fullName = `${firstName} if(middleName){${middleName}} ${lastName}`;
  return fullName;
}
// This works:
console.log(fullName('Mary', 'Moore', 'Tyler'));
// What do I do if someone doesn't have a middle name?
//add ? to the optional parameter and an if loop that includes the optional parameter
console.log(fullName('Jimbo', 'Jones'));

//4 Interfaces and function parameters ************************************************************

interface Student {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  belts: number;
}
function graduate(ninja: Student) {
  return `Congratulations, ${ninja.firstName} ${ninja.lastName}, you earned ${
    ninja.belts
  } belts!`;
}
const christine = {
  firstName: 'Christine',
  lastName: 'Yang',
  belts: 2,
};
const jay = {
  firstName: 'Jay',
  lastName: 'Patel',
  belts: 4,
  //belts was misspelled
};
// This seems to work fine:
console.log(graduate(christine));
// This one has problems:
console.log(graduate(jay));

//5 Classes and function parameters ***************************************************************

class Ninja {
  fullName: string;
  constructor(public firstName: string, public lastName: string) {
    this.fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
  }
  debug() {
    console.log('Console.log() is my friend.');
  }
}
// This is not making an instance of Ninja, for some reason:
const shane = new Ninja('Shane', 'Dooley');
//new was not included and no parameters were given and two are required
// Since I'm having trouble making an instance of Ninja, I decided to do this:
// const turing = {
//    fullName: "Alan Turing",
//    firstName: "Alan",
//    lastName: "Turing"
// }
// This doesn't actually create a ninja
const turing = new Ninja('Alan', 'Turing');
//the above will work
// Now I'll make a study function, which is a lot like our graduate function from above:
function study(programmer: Ninja) {
  return `Ready to whiteboard an algorithm, ${programmer.fullName}?`;
}
// Now this won't have the same problems as the Ninja was actually made as an instance of the class Ninja
console.log(study(turing));

//6 Arrow functions *******************************************************************************

var increment = x => x + 1;
// This works great:
console.log(increment(3));
var square = x => x * x;
//With only one return from the function it does not need to be within curly braces
// This is not showing me what I want:
console.log(square(4));
//With multiple parameters they needed to be within parentheses
var multiply = (x, y) => x * y;
//There are many mondules within the one arrow function
//So they have to be contained properly
var math = (x, y) => {
  let sum = x + y;
  let product = x * y;
  let difference = Math.abs(x - y);
  return [sum, product, difference];
};

//7 Arrow functions and 'this' ********************************************************************

class Elephant {
  constructor(public age: number) {}
  birthday = function() {
    this.age++;
  };
  // needs no parameters just needs to 'return' the age after it has been changed
  updateAge = () => this.age;
}
const babar = new Elephant(8);
console.log(`Babar's age is ${babar.updateAge()}.`);
babar.birthday();
//You call the birthday function
//Then you call another function to get the new age
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log(`Babar's age is ${babar.updateAge()}.`);
}, 2000);
